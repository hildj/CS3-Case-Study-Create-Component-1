# Dog Breed Visualization Case Study  
### CS3: Data Visualization & Analysis — Case Study Repository

Welcome to the **Dog Breed Visualization Case Study** repository. This repo contains everything needed to understand, explore, and complete the case study from the motivating scenario to the technical materials that support data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

This project uses a dog breed dataset to help students practice **exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization techniques**, all framed within a real-world scenario presented in the Hook document.

## Repository Structure

### **1. `README.md` (this file)**
Provides an overview of the project and a roadmap for navigating the included materials.

---

### **2. `Hook.pdf`**
A one-page scenario designed to *motivate engagement* with the case study.  
- Places the student in a realistic situation involving dog breed analytics.  
- Introduces the topic, context, and motivation.  
- Technical requirements (those are in the rubric).  

---

### **3. `Rubric.pdf`**
A detailed two-page rubric outlining:
- Required deliverables  
- Formatting expectations  
- Writing expectations  
- Code expectations  
- Reference requirements  

---

### **4. `DATA/` Folder**
Contains the dataset relevant to the case study. 
- A cleaned dataset used for analysis and visualization  
Students should begin by reviewing the cleaned dataset and exploring column meanings.

---

### **5. `Scripts/` Folder**
Includes all Python and R scripts necessary for: 
- Import and inspect the data  
- Clean relevant columns  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Reproduce the pre-trained model on Pytorch

---

### **6. `Supplemental_Materials/` Folder**
- A **blog-style explainer** introducing why dog breed visualizations matter in real-world decision-making (included in hard-copy)  
- An ** article** supporting the CNN working model and visualization techniques used (also included in hard-copy)
